Hi, I’m **Oleksandr Gerasymenko** — a Senior DevOps & FinOps engineer with extensive experience across AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD, and large-scale automation.

I specialise in:

- Cloud architecture (AWS & Google Cloud)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- FinOps cost optimisation & guardrails
- CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, GitLab CI)
- Multi-region, multi-account cloud setups
- Security, compliance, disaster recovery
- AI-powered automation (n8n, ChatGPT, Gemini)
- Technical mentorship & engineering coaching

I currently work in the UK and support teams across international environments.

I also mentor through **Google Cloud Coach**, **Projector Mentorship**, and help engineers grow in DevOps, automation and cloud careers.

This website is my personal hub where I share knowledge, write articles, publish tools/scripts, and document my work.
