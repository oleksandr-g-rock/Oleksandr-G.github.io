I’m **Oleksandr Gerasymenko**, a Senior DevOps & FinOps Engineer with more than a decade of hands-on experience building secure, scalable, compliant cloud platforms across AWS and Google Cloud.

My work blends **cloud architecture**, **automation**, **cost optimisation**, and **DevOps culture transformation**. I’ve helped companies reduce cloud spend by **30–90%**, designed multi-region DR strategies, built enterprise-grade CI/CD systems, and led engineering teams through complex migrations across healthcare, IoT, and AI domains.

### What I focus on
- Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean)  
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible)  
- CI/CD automation (GitHub, GitLab, CircleCI, TeamCity)  
- Kubernetes and container orchestration (EKS, GKE, k3s, ECS)  
- FinOps guardrails, budget enforcement, anomaly detection  
- Disaster Recovery, cross-region replication, multi-cloud resilience  
- Security, compliance (HIPAA, SOC 1/2, GDPR, data residency)  
- AI-powered operational automation (n8n, ChatGPT, Gemini)  

### What I do beyond engineering
I’m a **Google Cloud Coach** and **Projector Mentorship Platform** mentor, supporting engineers, founders, and early-career professionals as they grow their DevOps, Cloud, and AI expertise.  
I’ve mentored **20+ engineers**, run 1-on-1 coaching sessions, and help teams link technical excellence with measurable business impact.

### Why this site exists
This website is my personal hub where I share:
- Real-world DevOps/FinOps case studies  
- Automation tools and Terraform modules  
- AI-powered workflows  
- Articles, insights, and engineering notes  
- My journey building systems that are fast, resilient, and cost-efficient  

I believe in knowledge that is **practical, actionable, and transparent** — the kind that engineers can use the same day.
