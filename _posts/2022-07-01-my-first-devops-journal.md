Back in 2022, I started documenting my day-to-day engineering work — mostly for myself, but also to better understand the systems I was building.

These early notes shaped the way I approach DevOps and FinOps today.

---

## 🔹 Infrastructure as Code on real projects  
2022 was the year I fully transitioned from ad-hoc cloud changes to consistent, reliable Infrastructure as Code.

I focused heavily on:

- Terraform modules  
- multi-account structure  
- reusable patterns for IAM, VPC, ECS, S3  
- separating environments by workspace  

This was the point where automation stopped being “nice to have” and became the default approach.

## 🔹 FinOps before FinOps became a trend  
Even before cost optimisation had a name, I was already tracking:

- underutilised EC2  
- oversized RDS  
- storage waste  
- traffic patterns and CloudFront costs  

2022 was when I first started building simple scripts to send cost alerts and enforce best practices across environments.

Those early experiments later grew into full FinOps guardrails.

---

## 🔹 CI/CD maturity  
I standardised pipelines across projects using:

- GitHub Actions  
- CircleCI  
- GitLab CI  

Back then, the focus was reliability and repeatability — not speed.

But the foundation paid off.

---

## 🔹 Culture change  
2022 also taught me that DevOps is not just tools — it’s:

- communication  
- expectations  
- transparency  
- shared responsibility  

Small process improvements created big engineering wins.

## 🔹 Looking back  
These notes may seem simple now, but they were the foundation of the multi-region, cost-optimised, fully automated systems I build today.

This blog will continue where those early insights began.
