Inconsistent Terraform code reviews are a common source of production instability. When every engineer has a different review standard, deployments become unpredictable and risky.

The solution is to standardize the process. This moves reviews from subjective opinion to an objective, engineering-driven quality gate that ensures every change meets a baseline for safety and efficiency.

A standardized approach directly impacts infrastructure stability and cost management. It enforces best practices before they can cause downstream issues.

For example, a simple checklist can be transformative. Mandate that every review verifies resource tagging for FinOps, confirms module versions are pinned to prevent drift, and scans for any hardcoded secrets.

This structured process reduces deployment failures and provides the business with the predictable infrastructure delivery it requires.
